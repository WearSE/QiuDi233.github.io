[**Associate Research Professor**](http://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/575) at the [**School of Software**](http://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), [**Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **pervasive computing**, **mobile computing**, and **ubiquitous intelligent sensing**.

My work explores diverse sensing technologies and real-world applications in ubiquitous computing. Over the years, I have aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment, contributing to intelligent sensing systems that are robust, efficient, and broadly accessible.

I received my **Bachelor’s degree in Engineering** from **Northwestern Polytechnical University** in 2011, my **Master’s degree** from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** in 2015, and my **Ph.D.** from the same university in 2020.

I have published around **40 papers** in international conferences and served as the **principal investigator** of a **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Project**.
